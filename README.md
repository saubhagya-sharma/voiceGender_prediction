# voiceGender_prediction
</n>
This is a project taken up as a minor project by me to brush up on my model building skills.<br>
<b>Project Description:</b><br>
<b>Problem statement:</b> Create a classification model to predict the gender (male or
female) based on different acoustic parameters<br>
<b>Context:</b> This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon
acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded
voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-
processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an
analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).<br><br>
